# Corti X7 Small Accounts

## Overview
Corti X7 Small Accounts is a trading robot designed to work with small accounts. This Expert Advisor (EA) is implemented in MQL4 for use on the MetaTrader 4 platform. It is designed for users looking to leverage algorithmic trading for small investment accounts, providing efficient and automated trading strategies.

## Features
- **Automated Trading:** Executes trades automatically based on predefined technical indicators and logic.
- **Small Account Friendly:** Designed specifically for small account sizes, minimizing risk exposure.
- **Combination of Indicators:** Uses stochastic, EMA (Exponential Moving Average), and RSI (Relative Strength Index) for trade entries and risk management.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can adjust various parameters to suit their trading needs and risk appetite.

## Trading Logic
The trading logic of Corti X7 Small Accounts combines multiple technical indicators to determine optimal entry and exit points. The logic is as follows:
- **Entry Signals:** The EA enters a trade when specific conditions involving the stochastic, EMA, and RSI indicators are met:
  - **Stochastic Oscillator:** The stochastic indicator is used to identify overbought and oversold market conditions. A buy signal is generated when the stochastic crosses above the oversold level, while a sell signal is generated when it crosses below the overbought level.
  - **EMA Crossover:** The EA looks for a crossover between two EMAs (e.g., a short-term EMA crossing above or below a longer-term EMA). A bullish crossover triggers a buy signal, while a bearish crossover triggers a sell signal.
  - **RSI Confirmation:** The RSI is used to confirm the strength of the trend. A buy signal is confirmed if the RSI is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50), indicating bullish momentum. Conversely, a sell signal is confirmed if the RSI is below the threshold, indicating bearish momentum.

- **Exit Signals:** The EA closes trades based on a combination of take profit, stop loss, and indicator conditions:
  - **Take Profit and Stop Loss:** Predefined take profit and stop loss levels are used to secure profits and limit losses.
  - **Indicator-Based Exit:** Trades may also be closed if opposite signals are generated by the indicators, such as the stochastic moving into overbought/oversold levels or an EMA crossover in the opposite direction.

- **Risk Management:** The EA uses adjustable lot sizes, stop loss, and take profit settings to ensure that risk is managed according to the user's account size and risk tolerance.
